# web-technologies-programming
This repository is intended to register all classes and materialsas well as their resolutions for the Web Technologies and Programming of the third year of the Degree in Informatics Engineering at University of Aveiro.

This Curricular Unit trains stundents in the field of web technologies, focusing on the development of distributed information systems, using agile platforms. At first, full-stack technologies are explored, that allow the development of the entire system, from client-side design and programming, through server-side processing and ending with access to databases through agnostic interfaces. In a second step, advanced web development technologies based on configurable components and their connection to distributed systems through loose coupling mechanisms are introduced.
